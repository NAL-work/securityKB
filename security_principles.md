# General principles

* Simplicity: If a secure feature is too complex to set up, users will opt for the default or a more lax configuration.
* Least privilege: 
* Defense in depth: 
* Failsafe by default (fail securely)
* Use standard security frameworks
* Trust no one: Validate all inputs from users and external systems.
* Document, document, document:
