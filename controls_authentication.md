  * **Memorized secrets** include passwords, PINs, patterns, image selections and passphrases. 
  * **Something you know**: a memorized secret required to authenticate.
  * **Something you have**: something you can hold, e.g. housekey, ATM card, Yubikey.
  * **Something you are**: a biometric unique to a person, e.g. DNA, fingerprint, retina, voice, etc.
  * **Single factor**: Something required for authentication. Usually a passphrase or PIN.
  * **Second factor**: Something additional to a single factor required to authenticate.
  * **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** Required use of more than one factor to authenticate. Examples include a PIN and key card,
  or passphrase and fingerprint. _Note:_ a password combined with a secret question does _not_ constitute MFA, since both are "things you know."
